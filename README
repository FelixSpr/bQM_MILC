Parallel code for RHMC simulations of SU(N) bosonic Yang--Mills quantum mechanics

Top-level directories mostly follow the MILC layout:
generic   -- Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.
include   -- Header files for common procedures
libraries -- Single processor linear algebra routines
bQM       -- HMC and measurements

Dependences:
LAPACK is required for all targets
